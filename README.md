# Netflix Titles Analysis
Information Visualizations *MSBA Course*
### Description: 
Created a powerful and useful 6 page Tableau dashboard to tell a story about findings between the titles that are on Netflix all around the world. After the storyboard was complete I connected the Tableau file to Immersion Analytics which helped me create a 3D visualization of my graph. The Oculus Quest was used for this project in AI.

### General Information
Aimed this project to tell a story about the titles on Netflix and the Country in which each title was located in. I created a Tableau dashboard that I then connected to Immersion Analytics to create a 3D graph in the Oculus Quest. In the Tableau file I compared the TV and movie distribution, the count of titles in each country, the top 10 directors in each country, and more. The 3D graph showed countries on the x-axis and count of titles on the y-axis. The points were different shapes to represent the genres. Screenshots are below. 
- Purpose: The purpose of this project was to create a Tableau dashboard using data from an outside source and connect it to Immersion analytics to create a 3D graph. 
- Undertake: Using a beta program can be very frusterating, but also very rewarding.

### Technologies Used 
- Excel 
- Tableau 
- Immersion Analytics 
- Oculus Quest 

### Features
- Ability to click on each point in graph and get a lot of information from it
- Highlight segments of Tableau dashboard to show specific about that country/director/title
- Animation filter in graph on year added 
- See high level and deep level views of graph and Tableau file.
